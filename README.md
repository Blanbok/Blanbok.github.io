> I hope I can use this blog to further improve my skills and remember how I feel in the process of technology improvement so that I can improve myself better
  These are the things I'm going to record inside github
  Now my goal is only to make myself technically 30 percent of the country, and to master the way I can succeed.
  I hope that this way will let me no longer be confused about every day
  
# 1、[About My Own Benchmarking Management](https://github.com/Blanbok/AboutMyOwnBenchmarkingManagement/blob/master/README.md)
    
    I hope I can get the visible growth through the Benchmarking Management of standards
    
    * Find the target (a good project, a person who wants to reach the level of knowledge and goals)
    * Analysis of standards (useful things such as knowledge, habits, etc.)
    * The scale gap (the current gap with the target)
    * Action plan (to achieve the target implementation plan)
    * Next step (the next step can be done directly, setting start time, cycle, deadline)
